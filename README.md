# Image Classification

The usage of this repository is my initial hands-on exploration of image classification with a straight plan
Usage would be based on papers and code ready in GitHub as an example

For better usage of knowledge:
- Finish Coursera Course on Multivariable Calculus (Less than 5 hours)
- Finish the Machine Laerning Course by Stanford (20 videos)
    - Split into 5 videos for 4 days starting next week
- Finish the Computer Vision by Stanford (17 videos)
    - Split into 5 videos for 3 days

For STS: Continue work on source: Check Cumulative Counts, Document Background Subtraction (redundancy due to energy), read literature and find graphs that may have already been for the sources with other obeservatories

- Finish by Next Week Sunday: Both Stanford Courses

Note: As the libraries are simply the implementationsm, know the math first
For usual tensorflow implementation, StackOverflow and documentation would be best, however, an introduction to neural networks would be best with an introduction using Keras

- Good information for Image Classification code and papers
